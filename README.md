# CSE111-JAVA-PROGRAMMING-II
Assignment 01: Recap of Loops, Strings, and Arrays (2D and Multi-Dimensional)-
A foundational assignment revisiting essential Java concepts such as iterative structures, string manipulations, and handling multi-dimensional arrays. This laid the groundwork for object-oriented design.

Assignment 02: OOP Basics: Instance Variables and Instance Methods-
Explored the basics of object-oriented programming, emphasizing instance variables and instance methods. Introduced the concept of encapsulating data and behavior within objects.

Assignment 03: Instance Methods and Method Overloading-
Demonstrated how Java supports method overloading. Created multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists to show flexibility in program design.

Assignment 04: Constructors, Constructor Overloading, and Multi-Class Problem-
Implemented constructors to initialize objects and explored constructor overloading for different scenarios. Solved problems involving interactions between multiple classes.

Assignment 05: Multi-Class Design-
Designed multi-class systems that demonstrated real-world relationships between objects. Enhanced understanding of collaboration among different classes in a cohesive program structure.

Assignment 06: Encapsulation, Static Variables, and Static Methods-
Focused on encapsulating class properties and methods to maintain modularity and security. Explored the static keyword to create class-level variables and methods.

Assignment 07: Inheritance and Method Overriding-
Implemented inheritance to establish "is-a" relationships between classes. Practiced overriding methods to provide specialized implementations in subclasses while adhering to polymorphism principles.

Assignment 08: Review and Polymorphism-
Conducted a comprehensive review of all topics covered in the course. Explored polymorphism by creating dynamic systems that allowed objects to take on multiple forms depending on their runtime context.
